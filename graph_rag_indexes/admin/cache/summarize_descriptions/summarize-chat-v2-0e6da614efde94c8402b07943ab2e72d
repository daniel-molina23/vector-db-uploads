The essential tools required include fire-resistant clothing, a control staff, large meat rewards, and flying equipment. Additionally, the training setup should include flame-resistant targets, weighted obstacles, and simulated opponents to create a comprehensive training environment. To motivate and reward, trainers should provide large, high-quality meat treats and ensure a comfortable nesting area is available for rest.
